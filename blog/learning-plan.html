        <h2>Bootcamp Update</h2>
        <p>
          Having been through the Foundations course, my long-term goals and
          plans have not changed in any significant way. I still want to end up
          working in the Web3 space, hopefully working on improving Web3's
          adoption across Aotearoa.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like my strengths will be more helpful in Bootcamp than I
          original envisioned. Being a sociable and friendly sort of person who
          gets on with people easily will definitely help in that environment.
          I've also improved on a few of my weaknesses - I'm less liable to get
          sidetracked now, and can stay focused when necessary. Moving to NZ in
          the last week of foundations definitely helped with this - I had to
          prioritise my time as we had plenty of stuff going on! I feel like I
          might struggle with pair programming a bit - especially if I end up
          with someone who can be as stubborn as me - but I'm sure I can get the
          hang of it with some practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          One skill I would like to develop on Bootcamp would be to easily
          recognise other people's strengths and to know when to back down and
          be comfortable letting other people handle things. I've never employed
          anyone, but I feel like I might be a bit of a micromanager at heart,
          so I would like to nip this one in the bud.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expectations of myself and the DevAcademy team have not changed.
        </p>
        <h2>Long Term Goals and Career Path</h2>
        <p>
          After graduating from Dev Academy, I'm looking to pursue a career in
          Full Stack web development. I have a strong interest in Web3 and
          Blockchain technology, so will be looking to supplement my learning
          with study in Solidity, ethers.js and web3.js. Hopefully in the not
          too distant future I will be able to create my own decentralised
          applications on the blockchain. Depending on how this goes, I might
          look into blockchain architecture or security to skill up, but it
          remains to be seen if I will have the capacity to take my learning
          this far!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the short term I'll be looking to take pretty much any junior web
          development position to consolidate everything I've learned and get
          some real-world experience under my belt. Hopefully I'll be able to
          continue studying and improving in my spare time while doing this. The
          thing I love about the tech space is the constant drive to upskill.

        <h2>Strengths & Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          I have lots of both! I belive my biggest strengths to be curiosity and
          a need to try and understand as much as possible about a concept.This
          can also be my biggest limitation, as I can get 2stuck down google
          rabbit holes for days. It also lends itself to impostor syndrome - I
          often feel like a fraud unless I understand every little thing that's
          happening in a given scenario. In tech, it seems like nobody ever
          understands with this level of detail, so this is something I will
          have to learn to get around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work well with other people, and I think I have a friendly manner
          and am easy to get on with (please feel free to give feedback on
          this!) I'm not used to collaborating at a detailed level with others
          though, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how teams work
          together on software and what the dynamic is like. Hopefully I can
          pick up these skills, as I think that they are probably the key to
          having a successful career in development, rather than just
          understanding and generating code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it pretty easy to get into a 'flow' once I get started on
          something, and can produce quality work in a reasonably short period
          of time once the creative juices get flowing. My issue here is not
          being willing to admit that something was a bad idea if it doesn't go
          the way I want it to, and forcing myself to stick with it even if I
          know it's not the best way to get the desired outcome. When I'm in the
          'zone' minutes can turn into hours very quickly, so I need to learn to
          manage my time better and turn off every now again. I'm planning to
          take advantage of Toggl to do this!
        </p>
        <p>
          I can be quite negative at times, so I'm trying to be more
          understanding and receptive to other people's needs. Other people have
          problems too, Pete! The last few years have been really stressful, so
          I'm trying to break out of that slump and into a more positive and
          productive mindset. I'm sure this will help my teamwork moving forward
          as well.

        <h2>Workload Management & Getting Help!</h2>
        <p>
          As discussed above, it's easy for me to lose track of time or get
          over-focussed or obsessed with relatively unimportant things/tasks.
          I'm going to do my best to get used to using Toggl and the Pomodoro
          technique to manage my time better and ensure consistent progress
          through the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think I always treat others with kindness and respect, but
          as I move into a new stage of my career I will be reasessing how I
          interact with others to make sure they always feel safe, secure and
          heard. I think it's one thing to understand the importance of this,
          but quite another to put it into practice. As someone who is
          White/Male/Cis/Het it can be difficult to fully understand the issues
          that other people may be facing, so I'm going to try and be as
          receptive as possible to the situations of those around me. This
          includes other students and peers, facilitators on the course, and any
          other industry or community representatives I may have the pleasure of
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we all progress through the coursework, I feel we are all going to
          come to rely on each other more and more. When working in groups, it's
          really important to me that I pull my weight and not let the others in
          my team down (or worse, rely on them to do my work for me!) so I've
          already put a plan in place to ensure I can be present and focussed
          throughout the program. My partner and in-laws are behind me all the
          way, and are aware that during work hours I will be completely
          unavailable to help with the kids or any other tasks so I can be
          completely dedicated to work and study.
        </p>
        <p>
          When things get too much, I love to switch off and go for a walk.
          Walking (or movement of any kind) really helps me reflect on any
          issues I'm having and come back to a problem with fresh eyes, so I
          plan to take frequent short walks around the block to keep me
          refreshed. At times when I'm struggling with technical issues, I will
          limit my googling and thinking to fifteen minutes before reaching out
          to a facilitator in the discord for assistance. I think solutions
          stick better when discovered for yourself, but in time-sensitive
          scenarios I think this is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect the faciliation team to be available at all times to assist
          with any problems (technical or otherwise) we may find ourselves
          getting into. Rather than being handed answers, I prefer being taught
          by being steered in the right direction so I can come to the correct
          solution by myself. Another thing I want from the facilitators is the
          experience of working with and learning from people skilled in both
          tech and human skills, so that they can demonstrate the interplay
          between the two - which I believe lies at the core of all successful
          development.

        <h2>SCHEDULING AND COMMITMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          I'm committed to being available at all times during normal work
          hours. The only exception to this may be due to illness - having four
          young <span class="strike">petri-dishes</span> children at home means
          we are more susceptible than most to being struck down with tummy bugs
          and the like, but I'll be doing my best to give my all in all but the
          most unforgiving circumstances!
        </p>
        <p>
          From 5pm until about 7.30pm I'll be spending time with my family and
          getting the kids off to bed - they still to spend time with their Dad
          after all! During bootcamp I will be back to work for a couple of
          hours after this to make progress on whatever we are working on! This
          will of course be flexible depending on how things are going and how
          much work needs to be done!
