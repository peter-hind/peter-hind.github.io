        <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript - The Three Tradies</h2>
        <p>
          Building websites is just like building houses. There are lots of
          different parts involved, all of which need to work together to create
          a functional and attractive finished product. So while a house needs a
          carpenter, decorator and an electrician to get up and running, a
          website has its own versions of these!
        </p>
        <h3>HTML - The Carpenter</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            HTML isn't really a programming language believe it or not (neither
            is CSS), but rather a markup language. It's role is literally to
            label the content on the page and tell the browser what kind of
            content it is - simple! This HTML structure makes up the basic body
            or frame of the website. Carpenters do the same job when building a
            house - they lay out the basic structure and location of the various
            areas in the form of a frame. This frame <em>could</em> function as
            a very barebones house if required, but it doesn't really do the job
            by today's standards. HTML is the same; all you need for a webpage
            to display is an HTML document! But just by itself it will look
            pretty darn average (read: shit). We need some help from some other
            tradies!
          </p>
          <img class="basic-img" alt="HTML Logo" src="../img/html.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>CSS - The Interior Designer</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img class="basic-img" alt="HTML Logo" src="../img/css.png" />
          <p>
            Once our house frame is built, we need to make it cosy and suit our
            personal design tastes! That's where our Interior Designer - or CSS
            comes into play. CSS is another markup language just like HTML, but
            this time instead of laying out our frame and specifying what is
            what, we are taking the elements of our frame and specifying how we
            want them to <em>look.</em> CSS has an absolutely gigantic array of
            different aspects you can change on virtually any element, meaning
            you can decorate your webpage in literally thousands of different
            ways! Just like different designers can make the inside of a house
            look completely different, so too can different CSS styles
            completely change the look and feel of a website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>JavaScript - The Electrician</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very different beast when compared to HTML and CSS -
            and it is <em>definitely</em> a bonafide programming language. It
            enables users to interact with and control certain elements being
            displayed on a webpage, much like you could turn the lights on and
            off in a house. While HTML and CSS create the website and its
            design/layout, JavaScript brings it to life. Almost anything is
            possible when correctly using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in a
            complementary way.

        <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            A computer program is nothing but a big long list of instructions.
            This is what's great about computers - they do exactly what you tell
            them to! The biggest downside of computers is also that they do
            exactly what you tell them to - not what you want them to! A bit of
            JavaScript is just like any other programming language - a list of
            instructions that the computer performs one after the other.
            However, sometimes an instruction might be something like "go read
            this other instruction fifty lines down the page and come back when
            you are done", or "do this same instruction fifty times". Having a
            good command over the order in which you tell the computer to
            execute its commands is called having a good Control Flow!
          </p>

        <h3>Loops</h3>

          />
          <p>
            Loops are one of the most fundamental concepts in computer
            programming. Sometimes you want the computer to perform the same set
            of instructions multiple times, or perhaps on different things. Say
            you have hundreds of balloons and you need to know how many of each
            colour you have. You could write out the same set of instructions
            hundreds of times to record each colour for each balloon, or you
            could write a loop once, and have it repeat hundreds of times. Much
            easier! It's all about making life easy and writing as little code
            as possible.

        <h2>The DOM:</h2>
        <h2><span class="strike">Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness</span></h2>
        <h2>Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>
          The great thing about JavaScript is that it can change or move (or
          remove!) elements and styles from our HTML and CSS. This means that
          user interaction can change the way the webpage displays. In order to
          do this, the browser provides a JavaScript object for your JavaScript
          code to use called the Document Object. This object is basically like
          a family tree that contains all of the page's elements and styles.
          Using this tree we can write JavaScript that specifically targets
          virtually anything on the page and changes it how we see fit! The DOM
          (Document Object Model) is like the bridge that connects our
          JavaScript code to the HTML and CSS on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the DOM, every changeable aspect of the document is called a
          'node'. The document itself, the HTML elements, the contents of those
          elements - all of these are nodes that can be directly access and
          changed via the DOM.

        <h2>Objects, Arrays, and Functions</h2>
        <h3>Storing Data</h3>
        <p>
          Computer programs basically carry out operations on sets of data. So
          we have to have somewhere to store the data, right? Objects and Arrays
          are two different types of data storage that allow for large amounts
          of data to be stored. So what's the difference? Well, depending on the
          type of data being stored, you might prefer one over the other:
        </p>
        <h4>Objects</h4>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img
            class="basic-img bx-shadow"
            alt="Object Brackets"
            src="../img/object.png"
          />
          <p>
            Objects are essentially a collection of key:value pairs. So if your
            data set has lots of information about one particular thing (or
            group of things), then an object might be the way to go. For
            example, you could use an object to record all of the information
            about a car: <br />
            <br />
            let car = { <br />
            make: "kia" <br />
            model: "carnival" <br />
            engine: "v6" <br />
            colour: "blue" <br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            Objects have the added advantage of being able to store 'methods' as
            well, which are functions specific to that object (more on functions
            below). So in our example we could have methods like "startEngine()"
            or "lowerWindows()" etc. You may not realise it, but if you've ever
            written any JavaScript before you have probably already used
            objects. The famous "console.log()" command is simply accessing the
            "console" object and calling its "log" method.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Objects don't store their properties and methods in any particular
          order, as each value has an associated key to make it easy to find. So
          changing the make of our car is as easy as:<br />
          <br />
          car.make = "ferrari" <br />
          <br />
          Adding new properties is just as easy: <br />
          <br />
          car.owner = "Pete" <br />
          <br />
          The main disadvantage of Objects is iterability (if that's a
          word...?). Let's talk about Arrays and get into exactly what this
          means!
        </p>
        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            Arrays are relatively simple when compared to Objects. They simply
            hold a long list of items, with each item given an index by which it
            can be located (which helpfully starts at 0, not 1). This has
            certain advantages and disadvantages. Since none of the items has a
            key to locate it like an object would, finding certain things in an
            array can be a bit trickier. This is where iteration comes in.
            Searching through arrays using loops is a very powerful way of
            manipulating data once you understand how to do it. So while it's
            not as simple as getting a property from an object, with an array
            you can select multiple different sections of the data and
            manipulate them in a variety of ways that would be much more
            time-consuming if the data was in object form.
          </p>
          <img
            class="basic-img bx-shadow"
            alt="Array Brackets"
            src="../img/array.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Of course, like all thing in programming, this is just the tip of the
          iceberg. Things get much more complicated when you start seeing arrays
          of objects and vice versa! Again, I expect practice will make perfect
          when it comes to efficiently extracting information from complex data
          structures!
        </p>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <img
          class="basic-img bx-shadow"
          alt="Arrow Function"
          src="../img/function.png"
        />
        <p>
          So once we have extracted our data from our objects/arrays/whatever,
          we will probably want to do something to it, right? What if we want to
          do the same thing to a heap of different bits data from different
          places? Programmers are lazy and try to always avoid writing more code
          than they have to. Remember - DRY coding (Dont. Repeat. Yourself) is
          better than WET coding (Write. Everything. Twice.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of writing out the same piece of code every single time they
          need to do it, it's better to create a function. Functions are
          basically chunks of code that you can call at any time. You can pass
          them different data to run the same operations on. Lets say you have
          some objects and you want to change their color properties to blue.
          You simply write the code to do it once in a function, then pass the
          objects to the function to run the code on. Timesaver!
