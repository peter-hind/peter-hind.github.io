        <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript - The Three Tradies</h2>
        <p>
          Building websites is just like building houses. There are lots of
          different parts involved, all of which need to work together to create
          a functional and attractive finished product. So while a house needs a
          carpenter, decorator and an electrician to get up and running, a
          website has its own versions of these!
        </p>
        <h3>HTML - The Carpenter</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            HTML isn't really a programming language believe it or not (neither
            is CSS), but rather a markup language. It's role is literally to
            label the content on the page and tell the browser what kind of
            content it is - simple! This HTML structure makes up the basic body
            or frame of the website. Carpenters do the same job when building a
            house - they lay out the basic structure and location of the various
            areas in the form of a frame. This frame <em>could</em> function as
            a very barebones house if required, but it doesn't really do the job
            by today's standards. HTML is the same; all you need for a webpage
            to display is an HTML document! But just by itself it will look
            pretty darn average (read: shit). We need some help from some other
            tradies!
          </p>
          <img class="basic-img" alt="HTML Logo" src="../img/html.png" />
        </div>
        <h3>CSS - The Interior Designer</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img class="basic-img" alt="HTML Logo" src="../img/css.png" />
          <p>
            Once our house frame is built, we need to make it cosy and suit our
            personal design tastes! That's where our Interior Designer - or CSS
            comes into play. CSS is another markup language just like HTML, but
            this time instead of laying out our frame and specifying what is
            what, we are taking the elements of our frame and specifying how we
            want them to <em>look.</em> CSS has an absolutely gigantic array of
            different aspects you can change on virtually any element, meaning
            you can decorate your webpage in literally thousands of different
            ways! Just like different designers can make the inside of a house
            look completely different, so too can different CSS styles
            completely change the look and feel of a website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>JavaScript - The Electrician</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very different beast when compared to HTML and CSS -
            and it is <em>definitely</em> a bonafide programming language. It
            enables users to interact with and control certain elements being
            displayed on a webpage, much like you could turn the lights on and
            off in a house. While HTML and CSS create the website and its
            design/layout, JavaScript brings it to life. Almost anything is
            possible when correctly using HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in a
            complementary way.

        <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            The content of the element is what goes between the HTML tags in the
            markup. It could be text, it could be imagery... or it could be
            nothing! Some very clever CSS tricks can be achieved by adding
            styles to empty boxes! Most elements however do have content, and
            it's normally the content that gets out attention first.
          </p>

        </div>
        <h3>PADDING</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img src="../img/boxpadding.png" alt="Diagram of Box Padding" />
          <p>
            Padding is the space immediately around the content. Not to be
            confused with Margin, increasing the amount of padding will increase
            the size of the element's box! This is great for allowing background
            colours and other styles to carry beyond the confines of the
            content, and can be used to great effect.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>BORDER</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            The Border is the boundary that lies at the edge of the box,
            immediately after the padding. It can be styled in a variety of ways
            (or not at all!) to give a variety of different appearances. Some
            clever CSS tricks can be used with borders to add stylistic flair to
            otherwise boring elements.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/boxborder.png" alt="Diagram of Box Border" />
        </div>
        <h3>MARGIN</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img src="../img/boxmargin.png" alt="Diagram of Box Margin" />
          <p>
            Perhaps the most important of all is Margin. Margin defines the
            space
            <em>outside</em> the box that no other elements are allowed to
            enter. It can be used to position elements around a page, or stop
            them overlapping in some cases. From a design perspective, empty
            space can be just as important as content, and clever manipulation
            of margin can achieve this.
          </p>

        <h2>It sounds simple - but it's not!</h2>
        <p>
          It's really easy for all the padding and margin on multiple different
          elements to get confusing and out of hand really fast. Conflicting CSS
          rules can cause content to break the rules and burst out of its box.
          What's more confusing, different display types have different rules
          for whether or not they listen to padding and margin rules! Inline
          elements ignore vertical margin for example. Start throwing in things
          like Flexbox and Grid and it all gets
          <strong>REAL</strong> interesting!
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most things, I guess the best way to master it is practice! Lets
          do this!
