        <h2>The Pillars of Te Whare Tapa Wh&#x101;, and my wellbeing</h2>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Wh&#x101; is a model of the four pillars of wellbeing
          used to provide a M&#x101;ori perspective on health. Represented as a
          wharenui, each wall identifies with an important aspect of health,
          geared to the lifestyle and values of the M&#x101;ori:

        <h3>Taha Tinana - Physical Wellbeing</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            Taha Tinana refers to your physical health and wellbeing. Looking
            after your body helps you to feel mentally strong as well. In order
            to keep myself physically healthy throughout the course, I'm taking
            daily walks anywhere between 3 - 7 kms in length. I'm recovering
            from a knee injury which limits what I can do currently as well, but
            I would like to go swimming at least once a week too. I'm also being
            careful to keep an eye on my diet and not eat too much crap, and get
            as much sleep as my four children will allow...
          </p>

        <h3>Taha Hinengaro - Emotional and Mental Wellbeing</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img
            src="../img/mental.png"
            alt="Mental Wellbeing Icon"
            class="icon-img"
          />
          <p>
            Taha Hinengaro refers to your mental and emotional health. Despite
            being fundamentally connected to your physical wellbeing, it's
            important to take steps to manage mental health too. My current
            major effort to reduce stress and improve my mental health is moving
            to NZ to get some family support with the kids! This will hopefully
            free up a bit more time for walks and guided meditations etc, so I'm
            hoping the move will be a great catalyst for better mental health
            all round!

        <h3>Taha Wairua - Spiritual Wellbeing</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            Taha Wairua refers broadly to spiritul health. This can manifest as
            a relgious belief in a higher power, but not necessarily. For some
            people, myself included, it's simply a reflection of your own way of
            feeling connected to the universe through your own identity. I'm a
            nature lover and martial artist, so I find my version of spiritual
            wellbeing either on the Aikido Mat / Kendo Floor, or wandering
            through the hills. I'm hoping to find time for plenty of both once
            we arrive in Christchurch!

        <h3>Tah Wh&#x101;nau - Familial Wellbeing</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <img src="../img/family.png" alt="Familiy Icon" class="icon-img" />
          <p>
            Wh&#x101;nau is all about family, colleagues, and people you feel
            close to in your communities. Relationships with these people play a
            huge and valued role in your wellbeing. The main reason behind our
            decision to move back to NZ was so we could be closer to family.
            Apart from familial ties, I'm planning to reconnect with my Aikido
            and Kendo wh&#x101;nau in NZ, as it's been many years since we've
            all trained together! I feel like reconnecting my social circles
            will help me with both my mental and spiritual health.

        <h3>Whenua - Land</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <p>
            Whenua is a very important concept in M&#x101;ori culture, referring
            to a strong connection to the natural environment as the foundation
            upon which the other pillars stand. I'm a devout believer in the
            power of nature for improving health, and have been using Japanese
            techniques like Shinrin Yoku (forest bathing) for many years. I'll
            continue to let nature be a key part of my day-to-day moving
            forward.
