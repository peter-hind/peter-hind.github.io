        <h2>My Reflections on Core Development</h2>
        <h3>Me, myself & my ego</h3>
        <p>
          Three things I've learned about myself since engaging in core learning:
          <ol>
            <li>I tend to feel pushed to live up to the accomplishments of others, and can feel a little threatened by their success. I've learned that this is a feature of a fixed mindset rather than a growth mindset, and that I should instead celebrate the achievements of others, and try to use them to further my own development.</li>
            <li>I'm not used to sharing details about myself, and find doing so much harder than I thought I would. I didn't realise this until I started writing honest blog posts about myself that I knew other people would end up reading! I'm working to try and feel a bit more chill about the whole process.</li>
            <li>I used to believe that 'mindfulness' was just a buzz-word used by wishy-washy types, but I was surprised to discover that it actually has genuine and scientifically proven benefits. Since researching this topic I've managed to make some mindfulness time each day.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>The Role of Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in Learning & Programming</h3>
        <p>
          The core development section of the foundations course has made it clear that both learning and programming are things that can be greatly enhanced when done together with other people. In order to be your best and whole self, a clear understanding of ones own values and principles is essential (knowing what makes you you!) Equally important is respect and empathy for the values and principles of those you find yourself working with (even if they differ from yours!) If you can fully understand and take these concepts on board then your development as a learner and programmer will advance quickly and happily - plus you will grow as a person! What's the downside?
        </p>
        <h3>Surprises</h3>
        <p>
          At first I was surprised at the balance between the core skills and tech skills (much more core than I expected!), but as I progressed through the core curriculum I was surprised at the efficacy of regular mindfulness practice, as well as journaling and listening/looping. Generally speaking my biggest surprise is that active practice to change your mindset and preconceptions actually works!
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          I think my biggest challenge from the core skills curriculum was still creating this blog and writing an introduction post about myself. I wasn't expecting it to be so hard, but I was determined to just put myself out there and get started. I had a lot of writer's block on that first entry, and it was a real struggle to get going with this side of the curriculum. Now that we are a few more posts down the road, it's getting steadily easier. I must be doing something right (maybe?)
        </p>
        <h3>Why is DevAcademy focusing on Core Skills?</h3>
        <p>
          Five weeks ago I asked myself this question. Now the answer seems very clear! When looking for employment in the tech space, employers aren't that interested in your technical capabilities (surprisingly). Instead, they are looking for candidates who are a good fit for their team. These people will always be those who have well developed social skills, and can conduct themselves impressively in a team setting. Also, developing these skills works in tandem with your technical skills to improve yourself as a developer! 
        </p>
        <h3>Are Core Skills a waste of time?</h3>
        <p>I think this answer has to differ from person to person depending on what they took away from it. Some people might come from backgrounds where they already have these skills well developed, and didn't gain that much new knowledge. To them, they might have preferred more time programming. I think most of us however would disagree with this, and say that we learned a lot about the importance of soft skills in the tech space. Personally, I'll continue to refine my core skills throughout the rest of the course, and probably the rest of my life!</p>
