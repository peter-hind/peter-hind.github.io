        <h2>HTML Elements and their Boxes</h2>
        <p>
          HTML Elements and their layout are responsible for forming the basic
          structure of a webpage. Different elements can nest within one another
          to create unique and interesting formats. However, for these elements
          to come to life and display as their designer intended, CSS is
          required. CSS is a markup language which tells internet browsers how
          to display HTML elements, and the one of the most important things
          specified by the CSS for each element is how to display the element's
          box model.
        </p>
        <p>The box model is made up of four components:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>The Content</li>
          <li>The Padding</li>
          <li>The Border</li>
          <li>The Margin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CSS can tell a browser how to display each of these components in very
          different ways. Take a look at the below examples of the same element
          formatted with different alterations to the box model:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-grid2">
          <p id="bx-example1">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>
          <p id="bx-example2">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>
          <p id="bx-example3">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>
          <p id="bx-example4">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>
          <p id="bx-example5">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>
          <p id="bx-example6">I'M AN ELEMENT AND I HAVE A BOX!</p>

        <h2>The Components Explained</h2>
        <h3>CONTENT</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            The content of the element is what goes between the HTML tags in the
            markup. It could be text, it could be imagery... or it could be
            nothing! Some very clever CSS tricks can be achieved by adding
            styles to empty boxes! Most elements however do have content, and
            it's normally the content that gets out attention first.
          </p>

        </div>
        <h3>PADDING</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <img src="../img/boxpadding.png" alt="Diagram of Box Padding" />
          <p>
            Padding is the space immediately around the content. Not to be
            confused with Margin, increasing the amount of padding will increase
            the size of the element's box! This is great for allowing background
            colours and other styles to carry beyond the confines of the
            content, and can be used to great effect.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>BORDER</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex">
          <p>
            The Border is the boundary that lies at the edge of the box,
            immediately after the padding. It can be styled in a variety of ways
            (or not at all!) to give a variety of different appearances. Some
            clever CSS tricks can be used with borders to add stylistic flair to
            otherwise boring elements.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/boxborder.png" alt="Diagram of Box Border" />
        </div>
        <h3>MARGIN</h3>
        <div class="blog-flex blog-flex2">
          <img src="../img/boxmargin.png" alt="Diagram of Box Margin" />
          <p>
            Perhaps the most important of all is Margin. Margin defines the
            space
            <em>outside</em> the box that no other elements are allowed to
            enter. It can be used to position elements around a page, or stop
            them overlapping in some cases. From a design perspective, empty
            space can be just as important as content, and clever manipulation
            of margin can achieve this.

        <h2>It sounds simple - but it's not!</h2>
        <p>
          It's really easy for all the padding and margin on multiple different
          elements to get confusing and out of hand really fast. Conflicting CSS
          rules can cause content to break the rules and burst out of its box.
          What's more confusing, different display types have different rules
          for whether or not they listen to padding and margin rules! Inline
          elements ignore vertical margin for example. Start throwing in things
          like Flexbox and Grid and it all gets
          <strong>REAL</strong> interesting!
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most things, I guess the best way to master it is practice! Lets
          do this!
